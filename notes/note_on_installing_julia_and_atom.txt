# note on potential trouble installing:

When I did this installisation on my ubuntu (16.04) laptop in January 2019 (when the laptop was a couple of years old), Julia installed without a problem, but Atom did not. The installion of Atom seemed to require the running a Pythion script that was complicated by the multiple versions of Python 3 that I had installed, and in different places on my machine. More specifically, due to staying up-to-date with Python 3 at different points in time, I had Python 3.5, Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 (in addition to Python 2.7). I had only very recently installed Python 3.7, and the is seemed to install to /usr/local/lib whereas the others were in /usr/lib. Possibly as a result of this and possibly a result of something else, some .so files in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so and apt_inst.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so) did not exist for the later versions of Python 3. So I did two things, firstly installed Python 3.7 again but this time to /usr/lib (see links below), and secondly I copied the missing .so files to span the later versions of Python 3, e.g. 'cp apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so' and 'cp apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so', and similarly for the other .so file. After doing these two things the installion of Atom worked fine (I'm not sure which solved the problem, or whether both were required).
